Whether it's a ride-hailing service like Uber or Lyft, shared electric scooters and bikes, or microtransit, on-demand options are transforming how we get around. But do these services add to a more sustainable, accessible, and equitable transportation system? We’ll explore the environmental impact of on-demand mobility, the progress in making these services more accessible to all, and how integration with public transit is paving the way for a smarter, greener future.",
